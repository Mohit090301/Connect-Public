# CONNECT

With over 4000 lines of code and many days of struggle, I have built my Chat Application named "Connect" right from scratch using Flutter.

The database used for storing user's data(name, email, profile pic only) and chats is Firebase(which is a NoSQL database made by Google).The code is mainly written in dart programming language and a small part of it is written in Java Script.
